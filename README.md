#Understanding BMI is understanding our body 
Taking care of physical well-being is essential to maintaining a healthy life and preventing chronic diseases. Understanding and monitoring our physical condition through tools such as calculating the Body Mass Index (BMI) allows us to have a clear view of our body composition. BMI is a simple measure that relates weight and height, providing an estimate of whether we are in a healthy range, underweight, overweight or obese. This knowledge is crucial, as a BMI outside the normal range can be indicative of increased risks for conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer. By using BMI as a guide, we can make informed decisions about our diet, exercise and other lifestyle habits, putting us on the path to better physical well-being and a higher quality of life.

The formula used is: weight (kg) / [height (m)]2

Results:
<16: Severe thinness
16-17: Moderate thinness
17-18.5: Slight thinness
18.5-25: Normal weight
25-30: Overweight
30-35: Mild obesity
35-40: Moderate obesity
>40: Morbid obesity

Using data verified and approved by the WHO, I have developed a calculator that allows me to evaluate the user's BMI, in addition to providing the result and offering some personalized recommendations to improve their physical well-being, with the aim of contributing to improving the quality of life of people and help them understand the way they live it.
